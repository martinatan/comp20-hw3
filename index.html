				<h2>Take a Campus Tour!</h2>
				<p>Enjoy a walking tour of state-of-the-art campus facilities such as Tisch Library, Tisch Gym, and the Tisch College of Civic Life. Get a history lesson from a trained campus tour guide on as many things as they can remember without having checked the handbook for a while. You won't believe how tragic our mascot Jumbo's story actually is!</p>

				<h2>Eat Lunch with a Jumbo!</h2>
				<p>Pay for my lunch! In return you get to watch me eat some amazing breakfast food while I talk with my mouth full about what I'm studying, how Hill Hall was actually a great first-year dorm, and how incredibly interdisciplinary Tufts and how that is unique from other schools somehow. You are allowed to eat too.</p>

				<h2>Meet Active Members of the Community!</h2>
				<p>You will be able to see me interact with various people that at least like to say hi to me in passing, on a good day. Otherwise you might not meet anyone. If you tell me what you're interested in studying, I will promise you the emails of anyone I know in that major and then I might forget that I wrote your email address in my notes app, but I will see it eventually.</p>
